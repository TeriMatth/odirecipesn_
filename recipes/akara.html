<ol class="ordered">
<li>Combine the beans with 1/4 cup water in a blender.</li>
<li>Puree the mixture to a smooth paste</li>
<li>Pour the pureed beans into a bowl. Mix for 5 minutes with a whisk or mixer. This is to incorporate air into the batter.</li>
<li>Set a deep pan on medium heat, add in some oil. Heat until oil.</li>
<li>Add in the salt, baking soda, chopped pepper and onions. Stir
Scoop 1/2 cooking spoon of batter into oil. You do not want to <br>spread out the batter in the oil, you want to pour batter directly on itself (the way you would pour water into a narrow bottle).</li>
<li>Fry on each side until golden brown .</li>
<li>Lift the akara balls out with a slotted spoon and drain on kitchen paper towels.</li>
<li>Repeat the process until everything is fried.</li>
<li>Serve with bread, garri, ogi(pap) or fried yam. Enjoy!!</li>
