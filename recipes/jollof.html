<h2> DESCRIPTION</h2>
<p>
JOLLOF RICE: What is it? Rice made with tomatoes, onions, scotch bonnets, and chili peppers. There are endless variations on this recipe, but those five ingredients are usual constants.</p>

<P>No list of Nigerian foods can be complete without a mention of Jollof rice. It's a party dish brought out at celebrations, a signature regional dish, and the recipe with which many West African communities — and countries — like to stir up friendly rivalries. If I had to pick just one favorite from this entire list, this one would probably be it
</p>

<h3>Ingredients for making Jollof rice</h3>
<ul>
<li>4 cups of rice</li>
<li>1kg Chicken/beef</li>
<li>1000ml of Ground Fresh tomatoes.</li>
<li>50ml Ground Fresh peppers.</li>
<li>1 Teaspoon Curry powder</li>
<li>1 teaspoon Thyme</li>
<li>1 teaspoon Nutmeg powder</li>
<li>2 seasoning cubes</li>
<li>1 cup of sliced onions</li>
<li>300ml vegetable</li>
<li>salt to taste.</li>
<li>2 cloves of garlic</li>
<li>2 fingers of ginger</li>
	
</ul>

<h4>Steps</h4>
<p>The following are steps for making Jollof rice</p>

<ol>
	<li>
Season the chicken/beef with a teaspoon of salt, one seasoning cubes, <br>half a teaspoon each of curry and thyme, half a cup of sliced onions then let it sit for some minutes.</li>

<li>Set on heat and let it boil for 10-15 minutes, would take more time to cook the beef.</li>


<li>Set aside the meat and the stock in fresh bowls.</li>

<li>Peel off the outer back of the ginger/garlic, pound, or grind.</li>


<li>Parboil rice the normal way, boil about 7 cups of water in a pot,<br> add the four cups of rice and allow boiling for 3 minutes. Then pour out and wash <br>thoroughly with clean water, then set aside in a bowl or plastic sieve.</li>


<li>Pick out the parboiled tasty meat and deep-fry, set aside.</li>

<li>Once you are done with frying the chicken, reduce the oil to 250ml (1 cup) <br>just add the remaining one cup of sliced onions, stir for 1-2 minutes, add the ground tomatoes.<br> I like to cook jollof rice with the same oil I used while frying the meat.</li>

<li>Using a fresh oil is just the same as cooking without the beef stock (meat water) <br>which actually holds over 70 percent of the ingredient that is used in making most Nigerian foods.</li>



<li>Frying the tomatoes would take about 20 minutes.</li>

<p>Fry until when you lift a portion with your frying spoon, you will notice the oil continues to boil in the spoon.

You also notice the tomatoes turning dark.</p>


<li>Once the tomato is well fried, add the meat water (chicken stock) <br>to the fried tomato in the pot, the ground ginger/garlic, half a teaspoon <br>each of curry and thyme, salt to taste, add 4 cups of water.</li>

<li>Add another seasoning cube. Stir and taste, it should taste overly spiced. <br>Don’t worry, once the rice is added the taste would balance.</li>



<li>Add the rice.</li>
